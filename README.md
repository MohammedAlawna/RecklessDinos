# Preface
- Enjoy the trial of our simple 2D-adventure game! This game was made by Unity3D. All of the in-game characgers assets was purchased
and I'm legally able to use them for both commercial and teaching use.
- Some of the UIs used in the game like (logo, buttons, and etc..) were designed/edited by me using Photoshop/Illustrator. 
- Coded the game state.
- Implemented the animation for the movement and jumping.
- Connected the health and weapon to the animation state.
- 2-Prototypes of enemies created.
- Game made for mobile devices so the controls only work their. In te future once the game done and hopefully then I can implement
the PC game controls and deploy it to the users.
- Improvements and more moedification coming, just need some time to continue the project.
